So react is basically devided into 2 categories that are react-dom and react-native

If a user has to make any website than he will use react with react-dom but if he wants to make apps and all then
react-native is used

Now to start a react propject we need to write in the terminal npx create-react-app where npx is node package executor
but this is a slow way to do this 

NOW IN REACT WE RENDER HTML LIKE WE CAN MAKE A FUNCTION AND HENCE RETURN HTML TAGS 
So, What basically happening is that we create a root by reactDom.createroot and give it the value by doc.getelementbyid('root')
that root is in index.html
now by using .render and calling <app /> which is a function defined by us returning a h1
or we can say html


SO LONG THING SHORT BY USING REACT WE CAN MAKE HTML AS A PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE

ACTUALLY WE ARE USING VITE THEREFORE THE SCRIPT TAG IS ALREADY WRITTEN IN INDEX.HTML
BUT IF WE WOULD HAVE USED CORE REACT THAT IS THROUGH NPX THEN WE WOULD HAVE SEEN THAT THE SCRIPT IS CALLED BY SCRIPTS



Now lets make some function but before that some points to be noted
-->function must always start with a capital letter
-->In jsx file type we can only return only one fragment in a function eg. <h1>is one fragment
-->To overcome that we make use of <> </> wrapper


  Now we should also know how to work with the variables in this so we can return any variable of js by {var}
  But we need to make sure that we can only perform return operations i.e we can not perform logical oper there
  So to perform any logical opern we can perform it outside the return we can not perform any if and else statement
  there as it is an evaluated statement and js has some syntax which we on our own cant manipulatee
